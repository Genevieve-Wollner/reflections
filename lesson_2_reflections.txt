What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  > You create the repository, if you don't do this step you can't use git for your
  projects!

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
  > It is a space in which you can decide what files need changes committed as opposed
  to having to update every file in your working directory/ repository at a time.
